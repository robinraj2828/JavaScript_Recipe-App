# JavaScript_Recipe-App
An Awesome Recipe App using HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript .

In this Project, we make use of the **MealDB API**. This API is easy to use.

This project consists of search input and a search button. The user enters the dish name of his choice into this input and hits the search button. When the user clicks on the search button, it displays an image of the respective meal, its name, and the country of origin.

Along with this, we have a 'View Recipe' button. When the user clicks on this button, there show a list of ingredients along with the measure, and a pop up opens up with the instructions to cook the meal. 

## Project Folder Structure:
we create a project folder called - **"Recipe App"**. Inside this folder, we have three files. The first one is *index.html* which is the HTML document. Next, we have *style.css* which is our stylesheet. And finally, we have *script.js* which is the script file.

## Project Description:
### HTML:
Let us begin with the HTML code. The HTML will help us to create the structure for the list with some necessary attributes and elements to make Recipe App Project.

### CSS:
Then we will use CSS which will help us to style or design the project with suitable padding and alignment in the Recipe App Project

### JavaScript:
Finally, we will use JavaScript which will add a logic to make the Recipe App Project responsive from the user end.
